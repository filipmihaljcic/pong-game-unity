# Pong Game Unity 

This is a recreation of clasic 2D pong game built way back in 1972 by Atari. This game shows fairly basic principles of Unity. It uses mostly Unity physics engine and shows how it can be manipulated. Code related it's not very difficult just few scripts for player paddle, computer paddle, score tracking and game managment. Of course much more stuff can be implemented into the game but this is just "shell" for more ideas.

Bellow is gameplay footage:
